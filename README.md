# Concierge MD

Concierge MD is a web-based application designed to connect patients with physicians through a user-friendly interface. The application enables users to:

- Create and manage their profiles.
- View and select physicians who are associated with the platform.
- Leave ratings and reviews for physicians they have visited (when signed in).

## Introduction
The purpose of Concierge MD is to lay the groundwork for a more extensive healthcare-related application. It targets both physicians looking to enhance their digital presence and patients seeking to share their experiences with healthcare providers.
