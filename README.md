# Concierge MD

Concierge MD is a web-based application designed to connect patients with physicians through a user-friendly interface. The application enables users to:

- Create and manage their profiles.
- View and select physicians who are associated with the platform.
- Leave ratings and reviews for physicians they have visited (when signed in).

## Introduction
The purpose of Concierge MD is to lay the groundwork for a more extensive healthcare-related application. It targets both physicians looking to enhance their digital presence and patients seeking to share their experiences with healthcare providers.


## Installation

This application is still under development and not currently hosted, however, users can clone and run code locally via:

## Features

- User Profile Management: Users can create profiles, login, and logout.
- Physician Directory: View physicians subscribed to the application.
- Review System: Comment and rate physicians (requires login).
- Payment Integration: Stripe integration for potential future features.

## Configuration
No special configuration is needed to run the application. All settings are managed within the code base.

## Development

Currently, there are no specific development guidelines or setup instructions beyond what is listed in the "Getting Started" section.
